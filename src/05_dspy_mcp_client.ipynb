    "## Quick DSPy Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy** is a declarative framework for programming with language models. Unlike imperative approaches (manually crafting prompts), DSPy lets you define **what** you want, not **how** to prompt for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signatures**: Input/output specifications that tell the LLM what task to perform\n",
    "   - Think of them as type-safe function signatures for LLMs\n",
    "   - Example: `question: str -> answer: str`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**: An agent pattern that combines:\n",
    "   - **Reasoning**: LLM thinks about what to do next\n",
    "   - **Acting**: LLM calls tools to gather information\n",
    "   - **Observing**: LLM sees tool results and decides next step\n",
    "   - Loops until task is complete or max iterations reached\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MCP Integration**: Why DSPy + MCP is powerful\n",
    "   - DSPy provides declarative agent logic\n",
    "   - MCP provides reusable, standardized tools\n",
    "   - Together: Build intelligent agents without manual prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll see how DSPy makes MCP client code cleaner and more maintainable."

    "- One MCP server can serve many DSPy agents\n",

    "- **Observing**: LLM sees results and decides next step\n",
    "- `max_iters` prevents infinite loops (2-5 is typical)\n",

    "**4. Agent Chaining**\n",
    "- Output from one agent → Input to another agent\n",
    "- Each agent has its own signature and reasoning loop\n",

    "- Pattern: `result2 = await agent2.acall(input=result1.output)`\n",

    "**5. Async/Await Patterns**\n",
    "- MCP connections are async (network I/O)\n",
    "- Use `async with` for proper resource cleanup\n",
