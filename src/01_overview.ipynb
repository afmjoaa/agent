    "# Python Environment Setup with UV\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why UV? The Modern Python Package Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- ⚡ 10-100x faster than pip (written in Rust)\n",
    "- 🎯 Built-in virtual environment management (no separate `venv` module)\n",
    "- 🔒 Superior dependency resolution (avoids conflicts pip misses)\n",
    "- 📦 Drop-in replacement for pip commands\n",
    "- 🚀 Single tool for everything: venv creation, package installation, dependency locking\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- No official support for TU-Dresden HPC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speed Comparison:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Installing transformers + torch:\n",
    "- pip: ~2-3 minutes\n",
    "- conda: ~3-5 minutes\n",
    "- uv: ~15-30 seconds\n",

    "#### macOS/Linux\n",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",

    "#### Windows\n",
    "powershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Or via pip/pipx (Not recommended, because then you are still using pip)\n",
    "pip install uv\n",

    "### Step 2: Sync the Project Environment\n",
    "UV will read the `pyproject.toml` file and install all dependencies automatically:"

    "### What Makes an LLM Agent\n",
    "An agent is an LLM that can **do things** in the world, not just talk about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Components\n",
    "1. **Tool Use** - Ability to call external functions/APIs (web search, calculators, databases)\n",
    "2. **Memory** - Access to conversation history and context to maintain state\n",
    "3. **Planning** - Can break down complex tasks into steps and reason about how to achieve goals\n",
    "4. **Action-Observation Loop** - Iteratively acts, observes results, and adjusts approach\n",
    "5. **Autonomy** - Makes decisions about which tools to use and when, without constant human intervention\n"

    "### Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Function Calling?\n",
    "**Function calling** is the ability of an LLM to translate natural language requests into structured function calls that can be executed by external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function calling translation diagram](../assets/fc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Function Calling?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious reason is to provide **real-time data** to the LLM. Without function calling, LLMs are limited to their training data. With it, they can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fetch current information (weather, stock prices, news)\n",
    "- Interact with databases and APIs\n",
    "- Perform calculations and data processing\n",
    "- Execute actions in external systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are key design questions: **How do you want the LLM to call the functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Function Call\n",
    "2. Sequential (In Series)\n",
    "3. Parallel/DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)\n",
